1133249	1543828	how is atp produced	The actual production of ATP in cellular respiration takes place through the process of chemiosmosis (see Chapter 4). Chemiosmosis involves the pumping of protons through special channels in the membranes of mitochondria from the inner to the outer compartment. The pumping establishes a proton (H+) gradient. After the gradient is established, protons diffuse down the gradient through a transport protein called ATP synthase. The flow of hydrogens catalyze the pairing of a phosphate with ADP, forming ATP. The energy production of cellular respiration is substantial. Most biochemists agree that 36 molecules of ATP can be produced for each glucose molecule during cellular respiration as a result of the Krebs cycle reactions, the electron transport system, and chemiosmosis. Also, two ATP molecules are produced through glycolysis, so the net yield is 38 molecules of ATP. These ATP molecules may then be used in the cell for its needs. However, the ATP molecules cannot be stored for long periods of time, so cellular respiration must constantly continue in ...

The general formula means that the number of hydrogen atoms in an alkene is double the number of carbon atoms.For example, ethene is C 2 H 4 and propene is C 3 H 6.romine water is used to tell the difference between an alkane and an alkene. An alkene will turn brown bromine water colourless as it reacts with the double bond. Bromine water remains brown in the presence of an alkane as there is no double bond. Page: 1  1. 2  2. 3  3.

1133249	2713555	how is atp produced	Conclusion. A small amount of energy produced during respiration or photosynthesis is used to pump H+ ions into the intermembrane space. This creates a hydrogen ion concentration gradient on either side of the membrane, which is impermeable to H+. They move down the gradient through a protein complex containing ATP synthetase. When a 3 H+ ions have moved through, enough energy is supplied to synthesize one molecule of ATP from ADP and a phosphate. Peter Mitchell discovered this in 1961 and it is known as Chemiosmosis.

146187	8049312	difference between a mcdouble and a double cheeseburger	Natural unsaturated fatty acids are in configuration that is called cis, but partial hydrogenation can flip the chemical bonds into a different configuration that is called trans. The difference between cis and trans is that the two H atoms are on the same side of the double bond (cis), compared to being on opposite sides (trans). This may not seem like much of a difference, but it affects the shapes of the molecules. In a cis configuration, the double bond creates a kink in the fatty acid. In the trans configuration, there is no kink. Therefore, a trans-fatty acid is structurally similar to a saturated fatty acid (which has no kinks, either). The kinks in the molecules determine whether the material is solid or liquid at room temperature.

The liquid is enclosed in a tall, narrow glass (or plastic) column with a constant cross-sectional area. The increase in volume is thus due to a change in height of the liquid within the column. The increase in volume, and thus in the height of the liquid column, is proportional to the increase in temperature. Suppose that a 10-degree increase in temperature causes a 1-cm increase in the column's height. Then a 20-degree increase in temperature will cause a 2-cm increase in the column's height. And a 30-degree increase in temperature will cause s 3-cm increase in the column's height.
